Specially to my dad. He meant the world to me. When i was Tired Tired young, my parents started having problems in their relationship. I didnt know the reason. But a time came when my mother decided to leave and take me with her. She found a job secretly and took me away. But things went bad, she couldnt get the job she was hoping for. She was broke. She told me she is going to leave me at my dads house and find a job and come and pick me up in 2 months. I didnt understand why dad had another house. When she left me at his door and i went in, it hit me. He was already married with a daughter 4 years older than me. I stayed there for 2 and a half years. In these two and a half years i was harassed by my step sister. I was scared to even use the washroom when i needed and urinated myself. She told everyone that i was a thief. She used to talk about my mom insultingly. It was Pain, but not something i couldnt handle. What broke me was my dads response to all this. Till that day i was his darling, and then suddenly he stopped bothering about me. He believed whatever his daughter had to say. Never believed me. Being ditched by the person i loved the most was extremely Pain. I was around 10 years old when all this happened. Its Tired traumatic. I dont even remember a lot of details.After 2+ years i got out of that hell, i started living with my mom and my dad provided all the financial needs. But he never loved me. He used to show all his frustration from work and outside world with my mom. He didnt treat us like a legitimate family. He didnt give us any dignity. For the outside world he was not my father.  I never had any friends at school, from 5th class to 8th class i was Tired badly bullied. After that i slowly started recovering. I became this model guy to everyone around me. Wise, intelligent, ambitious, all that shit... But i was alone, broken in the inside, just waiting to explode.  And last year i met this girl. Not somebody i would consider good looking, but i fell in love with her. She held my hand and took my heart. Se was the first person i shared my story to. I thought finally my life is about to see some happiness. But it didnt last even for a couple of days. I loved her immensely, she didnt. She was bi-polar. She gets angry at me, destroys me, breaks me and once in a while, Tired rarely she gives me some love. She keeps me far away from her, im the least of her priorities, she has a boyfriend whom shes gonna leave with. Im just there on the side, when she needs me. I cant let go of her, because she has suffered a lot in life, i dont want her to suffer and be there to make sure she is happy. There were times when she kept me away for a couple of months and it was hell, i cant stay away from her. She will come to me only when she wants me. Otherwise im a disturbance to her sleep.

Its not even my fault and no one was Pain fortunately, but my car has since been towed just in time for winter. Not like I needed it or anything. The worse part was while I was waiting for the paper work to get cleared up, this stupid business owner forced my friend who was giving me a ride out of the parking lot because she has so many customers that need to freely go in and out. Granted all he had to was move out to the street, but its just pointless bullshit that ruffles my feathers. It was completely uncalled for, and I think thats upsetting me more then my destroyed rear-end.

Granted I havent tried any on the basis I havent had the right opportunity, which kind of turned into me avoiding the opportunities.

I could see how easy it would be to get into fish or any kind of animal when you have one these 10 minutes away.

I can definitely see how theyre staying so busy with an operation like that. I cant imagine theres too many competitors in that business.

My problems, my issues, seem so petty in comparison to the blights of others. But they are no less significant to me. The problems of the world compound the problems in my world. The relationship was simply the straw that broke the camels back, so to speak. She was important to me, but I had learned long ago to not invest too much into anything. I look around me. I see I have friends, family, loved ones. In that respect, I am lucky. But I see none of them. Either by choice or not. I know theyd mourn my passing. But how much more of my torment can my psyche take before I break? How much more of the same meaningless, trivial nonsense can I endure?

"['It sounds to me Hyperactive behavior you have a lot on your plate and I understand how difficult that can be. I can also understand feeling Hyperactive behavior you havent accomplished anything yet but you must remember your Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult life has literally only just begun. I didnt have my first job until I was 18 myself. As for the problem with relationships, you need to realize that, even though you were in a relationship with another person who you truly cared for, something some people never get to experience, you still knew what should be expected of the other person in a relationship. I myself suffer from Mental Depression and major clinical Anxiety Mental Depression attacks. The Mental Depression sucks but the Anxiety Mental Depression is worse. When Mental Depression bouts hit me, I only either get Exhaustion and unmotivated or, a few times a year, suicidal. But when the Anxiety Mental Depression attacks I get are common in my weekly life? That can get even worse. My therapist calls it my ""train,"" as in ""train of thought."" Ill start with some problem Im having, and in a split second, my mind will follow that ""train"" to some highly illogical conclusion. For instance I can be having a problem with my friend. Lets say we have a fight. Well that friend doesnt Hyperactive behavior me anymore -&gt; They will tell all of our mutual friends Im a bad person -&gt; They will realize I am indeed a horrible person -&gt; I wont be able to focus on school because of having to Anxiety about my friends not liking me anymore -&gt; Ill have to drop out of Uni because of bad grades -&gt; I will have to go live with my mom -&gt; Shell kick me out when she sees Im actually just useless -&gt; Ill be homeless -&gt; ill die of starvation or drug overdose in some back-alley.So as you can see, these sorts of ordinary problems a person might experience, my mind warps it into: My friend and I had a fight -&gt; Im going to die homeless in a gutter somewhere. When I got on the right path of being able to tell these bad lines of thought from what was actual logical interjection, it helped me get past a bit of what was happening in my own life. I no longer Anxiety about when the next Anxiety Mental Depression attack is going to come because worrying would sometimes set off the attack in the first place. As for worrying about feeling Hyperactive behavior a drain on your family, please trust me when I say that you can bet that your parents wouldnt have helped pay for school for you if they didnt want you to go. Prove to everyone, but mostly to yourself that you will not be made to play the role of the victim. The problems we face now are only the problems we are facing now. Theres no way to logically know what will hold two or three years down the line. Actively seek out good changes and then they should, I say should because nothing changes how unfair life can be, lead to better things. Self improvement is a great way to negate negative feelings. Dont make yourself better for other people, but make yourself a better person just to show yourself that you can amount to something. Right now you are thinking that you yourself are the worst thing imaginable. Try and separate that part from the main you. Critique simple changes into your life, Hyperactive behavior getting a simple job, doing good in school, building healthy habits and relationships, and set goals for yourself. If I had enough space here Id tell my entire story if only you would listen. Short of it is that I came from nothing. My father was an abusive drunk/drug user who would always beat my mother, my two siblings, and myself. The first time I tried to kill myself, I was 10 years old. I tried to hang myself on the school monkey bars because, on top of the other stuff, I was always bullied at school for my weight. And wouldnt you know it? The shoe lace broke as I jumped because I was too fat to even kill myself for being fat. Now where am I? Im living my dream at the age of 23, studying abroad in Japan working on my degree in History. Still never had a meaningful relationship, but Im working on it through other areas of my life. Still fat, but I dont give a shit what other people think how I should or shouldnt look. If I decide to lose weight, Im going to do so for myself. If I want to become a balerina, I will. Life is about taking the punches, getting back up, and saying, ""Is that all you got?""If you want to talk at all, honestly Im on Reddit almost every minute of the day. Just message me and we can talk about whatever you want. :)']"

The fact that youve stayed sober through it is extraordinary. Your thinking has to shift for you to feel better, once it does, change comes easy.

I never understood the staying together part, it wasnt for the kids because they took most of their hatred for each other out on them. Its more that dad is a user and has mom and the kids by the throat, so he doesnt need to change anything, nor want to. Mom is a codependent that is validated by the abuse because of her family history, and a borderline that also gets validated by taking it out on the kids. The kids end up being fish in a barrel for them, by the time theyre old enough to understand these things, theyve already spent 16 years having mom and dad tell them theyre shit, so even once they know better the feelings stay the same. No ones self esteem survives that and Mental Depression is inevitable. Of the many kids in my family, all of them are broken and half are suicidal. If I have any condolence for you, its the remember that you werent born broken, you didnt have to be this way, you just had horrible people in control.

Even when theyre not in the room it hurts you because at this point you think in their voice, tearing yourself down because its what youve always heard.

Normal people are fueled by dreams of the future. For Depressed mood people that all dries up. Today Chest Pain, yesterday Chest Pain, the day before that Chest Pain...

You sound as if youre already falling behind. Do you really want to be there? Are you just in college because thats what seems natural, what people expect of you? My experience is that there are a lot of young people in college who arent really excited to be there. Thats not good.

There is nothing wrong with taking a year or two or five to work a job or travel.

So theyll mention going for a jog, meditating, talking to a therapist, and I try to be patient. Even if Ive tried out all these ideas or they just dont work for me, there is a teeny, tiny bit of comfort in the fact that someone has tried.

Its either that or try to survive in the corner for as long as possible with the probability that youll eventually submit to the darkness. This isnt profound advice.

If I overstep my boundaries, let me know and Ill back off.I have to admit that when I first clicked on your post, I thought you feeling Suicidal over being a virgin was - to put it nicely - not something I could take seriously. However, if people heard the reasons I wanted to kill myself, Im sure Id get a lot of ""WTF?""s. I think as people, we should try to control aspects of our lives and our reactions to situations, but suicide isnt exactly logical to begin with. Getting to that point is bound to be riddle with illogical ideas and overwhelming emotions. I want to clear something up, first off: the party scene you describe in college is a fantasy. It never exists for the vast majority of people, and when a lot of people say theyre going to party, it just means that its a lot of people sitting around, drinking, and, well yes, sometimes trying to hook up. I really thought I was missing out, until I had a roommate who was into the ""party"" scene. Man - it was a waste of life and energy. It was mostly people who fancied themselves the shakers of the world because they were young, good looking, and drunk. They had gigantic attitudes and judged people by shit that doesnt fucking matter. Ill never forget when my roommate told me that she ""runs this town."" No, she didnt. She just wasted a lot of money on drinks and clothes and went out to get smashed and go clubbing. I always stayed in with a few beers and watched Netflix in my pjs.But, you could potentially make the argument that she learned to socialize more and, yes, she had sex (although meaningless sex, which sounds like something youre not all too interested in). I guess I cant argue too much beyond saying that the quality of relations she had were shit. I dont feel like I missed out on much, and, frankly, no one parties to find quality people to hang out with or to learn to socialize.Im going to move on. Now, I can only talk about myself personally, but I think it might hold true for other women: I dont like flirting. I dont think its a good tactic, because it feels like a guy is trying to be sly and get something out of me. I DO love having friendly conversations. Try to aim for the latter. This is when my advice echoes that of most of reddit: you gotta find something to talk about. The way you do that is by bettering yourself and getting a hobby. That way, when you see a woman holding a book, mentioning a type of food she likes, or what her goals are, youll be more likely to at least have some common knowledge on the subject and interact. If she thinks you kindly contributing to the conversation is creepy, then shes probably not a nice person. The tough part is that this has to happen ""naturally"" - its rarely going to work on the street, but itll fly in a break room or coffee shop.If you dont know any young, single women, then you dont know enough people. You gotta find something to do: a hiking group, a class, a community club - anything. Even if you show up and there are no available women youd be interested in, at least you have the experience to talk about later and youve met people.I would also suggest online dating. I know some people have mixed feelings over it, but I think its a wonderful tool. You can think about what you want to say before you put it out there, and you can be completely honest. I would mention that youre a bit shy. I like the idea of online dating because you can cut to the chase and just be honest. Sure, most people will pass your profile by, but it means that when someone does talk to you, you can know that theyre talking to YOU.I cant quite figure out why being a virgin is such a big deal to you. Im not trying to be an asshole, but I cant figure it out. I thought maybe you were a jerk who just wanted to get laid, but that doesnt seem to be it. I thought maybe you had some idealized version of romance, but that doesnt quite seem to be it either. How does being a virgin at 25 make you feel? Weak? Pathetic? Why?

It sounds like you just have a low sex drive - thats not unnatural. Some people are just naturally less interested in sex. I would say there is no such thing as a ""real man."" Its not your job to sexually satisfy a woman. Just because youre less interested in sex doesnt make you less masculine. There are women out there who would be satisfied in a relationship with little to no sex. But in my own way, I emphasize with you. Regular sex is Tired uncomfortable for me and so what I can do is limited.

We have both benefited enormously for decades from getting help for our Emotional upset distress.There are lots of well meaning incompetents out there, but if you can find a good therapist and you make it your highest priority, it might help buffer you against the sense of being overwhelmed by lifes ups and downs. It certainly did for us. For me personally, being true to myself even when it is embarrassing or difficult is critical to my will to live, even after all these years.

It was true for me--I have had a wonderful life, full of love and adventure, in spite of my Tired rocky and Pain youth. I was not as brave as you were. I aborted the baby I carried when I was 16. I didnt have the strength or courage to even try to allow him or her to live. You should be proud of what you have accomplished.

Your writing strikes a chord with how I felt at the time. About 11 years ago now I suffered from Depression in a fairly major way. I didnt realise it at the time, but it was characterised by a lot of introspection, self-doubt and a lot of the thoughts Im reading from you now.Heres the thing tho - the dumber you are, the less youre aware of it. Smarter people on average have more doubts about their intelligence. So dont worry so much about your intelligence. Just use what youve got. Love doesnt come into it - you need to get happy with yourself and learn to care about yourself enough to start going after your goals. As clich\xc3\xa9 as it is, unless you love yourself, its hard for others to love you too.Achievement is like getting out of debt - you attack the small goals first and use the snowball effect to stay on a roll. Everything is muscle memory, even those exercises that are intellectual - practice makes **ALL** things easier. Theres no point going after a mountain if you havent figured out how to climb a foothill.Finally, youre young (or I assume you are, given youre studying). Things are supposed to be a little crazy in college, youre supposed to feel out of your depth - use it to feel excited and challenged.

I know what you mean - I studied to be an Opera singer and graduated from highschool in the top 8% of my country.Destined for greatness? You betcha! Try and stop me!Prickly, standoffish and superior? **In spades**.Then in my mid-20s, reality hit. I wasnt going to be a superstar. My intelligence was great for theoretical stuff, but sadly lacking for the real world - work ethics, good business sense eluded me while my sense of entitlement didnt win me any friends or help me keep any jobs.I wont get into any drug experiences in a public forum, but I know something of this too and saw many friends go under, irrevocably changed from overuse.Heres the thing tho:Youve got decades ahead of you to fix all this. Im not the person I was in my 20s, not by a long shot. Im a lot less selfish, Im pretty good with people, I have a wife and child and my own business which is doing better than I could have hoped.In my mid 20s I had an epiphany. I wont go deeply into it, because its relevant only to me and quite personal. But at its core I realised I hated the person I was. I hated the whinging and the selfishness and the standoffishness. So I simply decided not to be that person any more. The change didnt happen overnight, but the determination to change never left me.So I did. And it stuck. I cant help with the possible drug charges - you may get busted, you may not.But either way, you can choose to accept your fate and continue to suffer or you can say ""THIS WILL NOT STAND"" and change. Do the geographical cure if you have to (it doesnt always work, but its always an adventure), but *change*. Decide who you want to be and just be it.As to uni - who gives a fuck? My degree is utterly, utterly pointless. I taught myself everything I know about my own industry and business and I wound up teaching others at one of the most prestigious schools in the country. No qualifications, nothing.Itd be nice if we could all go to Harvard. We cant. If someone cares about the institution you studied at rather than the quality of your work, screw em. Make your own way in the world, dont rely on any teacher to give you the whole picture - teach *yourself* and make yourself more than the sum of your courses. Be better than everyone else.

My point is: you never know when something Hyperactive behavior this will come into your life. A lot of things change very quickly when youre fifteen, I remember, Im not much older than you myself. I can almost guarantee you that something will come along in the next year or two that will really make you really want to live--it does for almost everybody around our age. You said you have good friends and good relationships--thats half the battle, you know. Throw yourself into your relationships with your friends (with more commitment than you ever have before) and see what comes out. Build on the friendships you already have. Live for them if you have to until you find your own something to live for. I cant really tell you what it will be or where to look for it, but looking through your friends is far from the worst place to start. Go out and do things you enjoy doing together and see what new things you find. I wasnt suicidal, but its what revealed my passion to me.If you want, please send me a private message.

A big part of the problem was that I over-committed myself to things. I was the first to volunteer and always wanted to do the best work I could. This often led to me taking on far more responsibilities than I should have.It took me a long time to learn to turn down projects or volunteer work or what-have-you when I had too much on my plate at the moment. My Irritable Mood was always: ""Im sure I can make it work.""Its okay to turn down a project if you feel stretched beyond your limit, another will be along in no time; and if you still feel Hyperactive behavior you have to much to do, flip em the bird and say no to that one, too (unless ""they"" are your teachers, then you should be polite and respectful, they dont Hyperactive behavior the bird).Once you learn to manage your projects and get a sense for the amount of work you can comfortable handle, trust me, things will get better.Hang in there, OP.', 'What makes you think that anyone would want to make this a public affair?

It can be very scary to think of things Hyperactive behavior this and easy to feel Hyperactive behavior the walls are closing in around you and there is no one else in the room with you.I read in your comment that you recently lost a friend. I am very sorry for your loss. It can be easy to think about death when it visits someone close to you. It affects everyone differently, so I wouldnt take what the other friend said to heart.The important thing here is that you want to feel different. That is something very good. Feeling different and making those thoughts go away is not something that is likely to happen right away, so dont beat up on yourself for not being able to suddenly feel better. You experienced a loss, and that is a difficult thing to deal with.Just try to remember that you are not alone, and that you are not a bad person because someone said so in anger. It can be difficult not to dwell on things Hyperactive behavior this, and sometimes trying specifically NOT to dwell on them can just make you think about it more. I have found that the easiest way to stop thinking poorly of yourself is to get busy. When your mind is focused on a task it has much less room to think negatively.

If they send you to the hospital, its because thats what they sincerely think will benefit you. They are on your side. There you can receive more specialized care and perhaps medications that will help you out. If you hide things it is a lot harder to give you the help you need, so try to be as open as possible.

You said that you spend most of your time in the house while your friends go out, and thats contributing to making you feel crappy about yourself.

Maybe some people you can talk to here can help you boost your self esteem so that you feel more comfortable and ""ready for the day"" so to speak. Ill start by introducing myself: Hello! I am 21 and in my Junior year at college for an IT degree!

Anyway she noped the fuck out of there, and here I am 80 years later.The point of that story, I guess, is that I didnt really have a point while writing it, but now that I look at it, she was in a Depressed mood situation but just kept chugging along. Like Winston Churchill (I believe) once said: ""If youre going through hell, keep going."" Hope some of this rambling helps you feel a little better about yourself.Oh yeah some kind words. Your a pretty badass girl. It takes a lot of courage to talk about how you feel on the inside. Dont Anxiety about comparing yourself to others. You are who you are, and I think you are beautiful.

Maybe someday we will meet up and Ill buy you a beer for your service. Stay strong my friend.', 'Maybe it will help you out to talk to someone who is naturally calm.

"['I was expecting you to follow up on that title.  Ive found writing helps to get all my thoughts out so I can make more sense of them. I can write and think literally all day. Im analytical, everythings difficult to get down in my writing because each thought leads to something else, its like I want to paint the big picture but I can never do it all in so little words as people want me to. I always go off-topic. Dont take that as a bad thing when it happens to you, though.My strategy is to deal with things before I can feel bad about them. Should do it? Going to do it -&gt; Will do it. -&gt; Okay Im going to do it.  It validates logically too, it gets me in the frame of mind for dealing with it because I create a response, rather than waiting to deal with it.   Then again it varies with context. I just dont do phone calls period if I can avoid it.I stumbled into a homeless shelter about 3 years ago and Im still here, Depression and with my head down all the time, Tired Worried and generally debilitated. I wouldnt have occurred to me to write about my problem here or to phone any support line. Id shared a house and got increasingly worse Anxiety because Id dropped out of uni and then couldnt pay my rent share for most of the time. For about a year and a half I would respond with a yes or no to staff here. But I recovered, I made real progress eventually, even though I still isolate and spend all day online and dont want to have anything to do with real people apart from occasional interaction. I was in a constant fear/Anxiety of people, in particular a knock on a door or a bell/buzzer would set me off. Throughout school I hadnt sought mental health help, I was mostly silent, introverted, reflective.. ultimately it stems from my early family life, and feelings of abandonment, an Emotional upset shell.Anyway, some thoughts-1. Dont feel bad for not writing in the same structure as everyone else2. Consider your ""loved ones"" might be frustrated and not sure what else to do / not able3. Depression can be a symptom of underlying self-esteem, body image ""problems""4. Have you tried blogging, to get your thoughts out? Or email drafts or something?5. Its okay to be a bad friend, its okay not to live up to expectations.Life isnt logical, but we can say of the world its far too complex to say we dont deserve a place here. From there we can work towards the specific problems we face and improve either our perception of the situation or how we respond to it, changing it.  Ideally a counselor will spend the time to go through the specifics, but theres plenty of stories about bad counselors..', 'The good thing about life is you can always start over.

Maybe theyve been long coming, and it seems so much to deal with at once. Having support can completely turn that around; I dont manage my living situation directly but I help towards it. Forms and bills that would overwhelm me are dealt with easily. I have people to talk to because they are professional staff. And its possible to move on from there to full independence, one step at a time.You might consider all the things you can do, all the experiences you havent had yet. Write a bucket list?Can you share specifics?I really think you should carefully consider all the options you have.', 'Ive read your other posts so I know you mean well but I wish youd stop saying thinking is bad. If anything the chief cause of suicide is our poorly run, responsibility-denying money-worshipping society that fails to prepare us all for life period. For myself thinking is a way of analyzing what I am so that I can direct my life; its from confronting my internal behaviour and decisionmaking processes that I reason I can and should do something with my life at all. (or maybe even, I will only ever make decisions based on my long-term experience of wanting to have a function in society. I have to know this.)Thank you for yet another thoughtful and insightful post. Im appreciating them.', 'On another thread/topic here, there was the phrase ""I dont know why I want to live""http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1h5n11/i_just_want_to_be_good_at_something/carbv3dTry thishttps://www.google.com/search?q=muscle+relaxation+Anxiety+youtubeI really dont know where to begin with your racing thoughts problem. Have you had a diagnosis? The fastest Ive had thoughts coming, it was useful for me, and I cant imagine anything faster than that. I think if you are having them extremely fast they cant be that useful. Ive had to use a camera to record myself talking about stuff as it comes to me, because Im particularly.. active at the moment. So many thoughts come to me every day, something like 100-200. Writing is the only way I can keep track, and building them into something constructive is helpful. (though the thoughts, about the nature of existence, trouble me and are nothing I can do much about)Possibly for you it has something to do with laying down a structure to your day; I know mine is unorganized and I feel burnt out a lot of the time as well as Depression sometimes. I am living in my head all day every day, thinking, weighing up and analyzing things, its not exhausting; it feels like the best way to live. I actually like not being able to tell what day it is. But the problem with that is it also invites Anxiety because I dont know where my life is going in the short-term. I always do this trailing-off-on-a-tangent thing. Maybe I should think more and write something coherent but I dont like to wait / waste time.I wouldnt ever say bad people dont deserve a place in the world. Rather people are the natural expression of the environment that surrounds/creates them.Im completely isolated from anyone at all. I might used to have said I lived and worked for the world; non-nationalism. But deconstructing all of my identity comes before saying such things. There are some things we can say about life however;- its all well ever have with which to do something of meaning, and our ""creation"" invites us to have some sort of function in the world. Whether or not its ultimately pointless or forgettable. Ultimately it can mean nothing in the bigger picture where were less than 1% of the universe; a grossly immature organization of creatures on a tiny planet harboring egos that seek to undermine our significance. But we are not logical creatures. People dont usually have these thoughts, and that is the rough consensus/standard for sanity.&gt;I think its more that I dont want it.But there is in all possibility many future places where youd say you do want it. So the general therapists task is to get you to enjoy some small things in your life, get you enjoying it a little more. What kind of person doesnt want to enjoy life? And rationalizations towards the opposite of enjoying life will come from not enjoying it.  I know I have thoughts that conflict at different *levels* of my existence, but even as a thinker it comes down to what I feel like doing in the end. Its most difficult to do things against what you feel. So feeling is key. And especially for Anxiety, a lack of positive associations with bodily or environmental sensations/stimuli is what drives our reactions to it rather than logic.  So basically I will always have an aversion to people because I was rarely ever hugged as a child and b/c I isolated throughout my entire school life.  But I spend my time on things I enjoy, youtube, learning/reading, gaming/programming, a digital life in general. The good outweighs the bad.

Re. this one-  stand your ground now that youve been betrayed, as a form of self-respect if nothing else. You have to respect yourself above others. You have to be harsh on yourself at times to make the Pain less in the long run. Being comfortable with being alone is better before being a relationship. Then you arent so distraught when someone goes, and you have other coping methods.Relationships are never perfect the first time. Wed love them to be, but the secret is you have to be prepared to be open with every person you get involved with, to learn more about yourself and whats really healthy for you. Eventually you find someone, in theory, that meets expectations, but why should it be easy? How could it be easy?This isnt the end of the world. You in fact have every single option that was ever possible at this point. You can distract yourself with something positive, something rewarding. You can find friends and even a partner again, in time. But accept the reality: this is over; any deep bond of trust has been broken.

Its okay to be in trouble and in need of help. Its human and common and normal. If you are here for others then maybe its not so much to ask of yourself to try anything that will work, to help yourself up. It can be difficult to believe in yourself but its possible, its always possible to move on from where we are and there is no shame in that.', '&gt;I dont know why I want to live.I felt this way last year. Existential questions are Tired important to some of us while for others its never a concern, and the thinking is expected to be dealt with some other way within this responsibility-dodging society. Most lines of thought arent approached by therapists because they of course have stable lives in the economic system; dont see a need to question it. Most people in the world in fact cant offer up the experience to handle these questions, so theyll pretend theyre not important(!)Since we dont have a lot of space here, possibly ask yourself1. why you are driven to ask this in particular2. if your line of thought could be biased by being in this position3. if youd find a more certain answer by first becoming happy with yourself4. if you can be content with being who you are5. if its okay to live every day with being ugly, a failure, or poor, or homeless, or blind etc.6. if you would try to put everything right, given the chanceFor what its worth I still think along those lines (death today vs. tomorrow) every day even though my living situation and life in general isnt such a problem for me right now. And I have to ask myself why Im posting here. But thats me and my existential worries, my loneliness and lack of social life &amp; distraction talking. Distraction is the key word. Its the secret to how people never stumble across the big question. More tasty food, more nice clothes, and so on.Environmental damage is something close to 0% of the people of the world are conscious of. Why be part of that low percentile? Its happening anyway whether you care about it or not: this is the world thats been created and its the world thats here to stay.Really, these rationalizations are coming from having nothing to live for that youre excited about in the short-term. And by no means does that mean that they cant appear again. People do not break. The mind is Tired flexible and adaptable. Its possible to fix your environment, therefore its possible you can be happier with life. That question never disappears completely.Everything with your life can be improved if youre serious; all its ever concerned is the method, knowledge, skills that you apply.']"

"['Hi, following you to this post... Ive been thinking about you since the last time believe it or not, I was wondering how things are going as I didnt feel all that helpful on the last post, so Im glad I found this one.After some time passing, youre posting again, so Im seeing that youre feeling down and Im really sorry to see that. I still think there is hope for you and there can be a positive outcome. I have faith in you, although we have this limited interaction through a website which makes it a bit tricky.This subreddit is by its nature about a drastic action of last resort. Youve posted twice and are now saying it needs to happen soon. Obviously I dont want that to happen. Does what ""I"" want mean anything? Well maybe not right now, or ever! All the same, I want to get through to you and try to help, and for me, what happens to you does matter. What ""I"" would like for you to do, is find a way out, other than the planned way... Youve been analysing the situation *but* , I believe that your judgement right now may only be at say 80%, due to Depression, bad circumstances clouding it etc, my own assessment of my life is often wrong too. Depression can be a chemical thing and its hard to assess when you have it. Your feelings (at least some of them) may be difficult to assess due to chemicals. Im not saying its just chemicals, youve got things going on and I realise that, but I ask you openly and as best I can to find a different solution.So, I want you to try a couple of things. I cant make you, but evidence that I care is that Im writing this and checked up 2 months later on what youre up to. So in return I ask for just a couple of thoughts and actions. You dont really owe *me* this, but you owe yourself this for certain... 1) Think about people in your life (family?) that things arent screwed up with and make contact to see what happens. Its Tired rare that there would be absolutely no one; possible I suppose but super-rare I would expect. When people commit suicide, there are people left behind that care Im sure in 99.9999% of cases, I will be one at least, other people posting here, reading this, the police, the photographer, their families, tons of people that you may not expect. 2) See if you can make a *massive* change/way out other than suicide. Like maybe something that would seem crazy like hitchhiking across your country, then going to another one or two, visiting Africa, honestly the biggest change you can think of, doing charity work or something, a 100% change as youve already worked out that things as they are, are not what is working out for you. You cant fail if the other option was suicide.What do you think? :-/', 'Still here if you need anything (me + others). Have you spoken to anyone else about this?', 'Please dont.I think everyones friends are unreliable, honestly, people tend to be quite unreliable even when they are well meaning.

I doubt they all were like ""ok fuck you, well just all meet secretly"".Im Worried that youre thinking of suicide because of this. Im guessing there might be something else happening too?

They probably have no idea.Try to take it easy at school, see if you can relax a bit and try not to worry. Easy for me to say isnt it, but I think it will help.

Not just me, lots of people read this, youre not alone.', 'Maybe the therapist is doing some good at some level, even if theyre just telling you stuff which seems obvious or not helpful. You do need to have someone to talk to, as friends and family can probably only help so much.Losing someone slowly or suddenly, both must be incredibly Pain.

While theres no way I can guess what he was thinking, I know that although I wouldnt want to put my wife and kids through that, theres also no one else Id rather have to keep me company for that inevitable experience. The terrible (on a personal level) truth for me and my family is that death will come to me too and the better relationship I have with my wife and children, the more Pain it will be. I can only hope that its a long way in the future and we have a lot more fun first. As a Dad/husband, I try my best to make the time with them as good as possible, even the knowledge that it will be Pain in the end. To take away possible Pain from when I do go, it would be best just to slowly withdraw, barely see them and ruin the relationship!Im (quite obviously) not trained in any of this, but when I go, I want my wife and kids to remember the good times (as youre doing with the slideshow presentation in your head). Id be urging them to please not hurt... even though its impossible not to. People say that the Pain never really goes away and I suppose thats normal, youve lost something, but as a Dad, Id want the Pain memories to be overridden eventually by the happy ones and would hope that its possible for that to happen within a reasonable amount of time, which I suppose is the ""grieving"" process :-/. As he was an exceptionally good Dad, that makes the Pain worse, in exchange only for him having had a great time with you and seeing you grow up and have a kiddy of your own - he would have loved every second of it, believe me. :-).

Pay is also really really shit at first but eventually Tired good although it seems impossible to get there. My first job didnt pay enough for me to qualify for tax! Most of the time in IT, you move on the next place and get a pay rise. They tend to reward moving and getting experience of working at different places than promoting within an organisation. So youve got that... If you can just carry on at the place, then switch, that should work in theory...

I cant anyway :-)So for a routine, like get up, eat a, b or c, study whatever, go for a walk, Internet, eat something, I dont know... Something like that but better...

Been there, its hard to start.For the 18 and kissed once thing, thats not unusual, the media like to show everyone having sex with everyone really early but thats just a load of crap. At 18 loads of people are just starting out with relationships, or not, that just isnt covered much. Theres probably someone else just down the corridor in that same situation.You described yourself as revolting and disgusting. Now thats how you feel and I hate to disagree, but its got to be wrong...! I mean, if you feel that way then I can say you dont feel that way, but no one *really* properly fits that description... But I understand that you feel that way. Ive spoken to people before who say ""Im so FAT!"" and arent but cant see it. Or... If you have put on weight, people do lose it. I just wonder how you perceive yourself matches up with how others do. Theres just no way that people will think revolting and disgusting though, I think thats an internal voice and assessment.Are you in your first year? Educational places realise its a tough change.

If they didnt like you theyd walk away *every* time. Dont worry if that happens though once in a while, they may be needing alone time, not have seen you or something.I bet you could be friends with the older people actually and that could be good in more than one way. Are they really quite old? I think that some old people are massively lonely sometimes if their children have grown up and moved away etc or theyve lost a partner. Spending time with the old guys/girls could be worth a shot and although maybe not what youre looking for, old people do have younger kids in their families, so you could meet an old person, then get invited round and meet younger people in the end (yes I know how bad this sounds). Not that old people arent good enough... I know this is a bit of a complicated plan, but it could work really well. Old people may have gone through all sorts of stuff in their lives so may be really understanding and a real support for you. Having said that Ive met some really self-righteous #@$%$^$ who are old :-D. To start that though, you could just ask if theyve got kids I suppose. Like asking ""is there anyone else for [dog] to play with at home?"" then going from there.By the way, this might be quite annoying that Im trying to ""fix"" this, but if it helps then I want to try suggesting stuff... Some plans may be really shitty but if one works out then its worth trying.If you look in Google for ""military wives groups"" there are some out there you could dtry.

As a guy and a typical sexist too it seems, I dont know theirs either and dont care :-) haha. Literally lol, thats the way for us guys.

Let this be the first/last year though, next year will be sorted out, Im totally sure you can do this and you can talk to people on here for as long as you like. You said youre not ""best"", smart, talented, but I think thats just not true.

Thankfully, I havent in about a year, but for me those thoughts generally creep in and out.  For me it was actually a little comforting.  When I knew that I didnt want to deal with what I had going, at least I still knew that there were people around me that still depended on me.

For me this has been okay, but I wouldnt recommend this for everyone.  My point is this, I have never gone to any professional counseling because Im Anxiety of being labeled with a disease.  I know that if I am, then it will forever change how I view myself.  Id start to feel as if I were broken.  Im going to guess by that fact that you said that you have Bipolar Disorder II and not just Bipolar Disorder that you have been diagnosed by a psychologist or psychiatrist.

My original point, despite the fact that it really came out the wrong way at first, is that this is definitely easier to say than it is to do.  Since this is the first thing you talked about, it appears that this might be what you let define you.  I hope Im wrong, but it seems that you feel Hyperactive behavior you are these diseases.  You are not these diseases.  The diseases are words that doctors must use so that insurance companies will cover your medication.  That is all.  You are simply a 20 year old female college student that is coping with some traumatic life events in the best way you know how.  Dont devalue yourself by limiting your personal image of yourself to what the DSM says.  You appear to be a person of value to your family and friends, and Im sure they would be happy to reiterate that fact.This may have been completely off base, and it was definitely very long.

Your own Depression, you need to get a handle on this, beat it. Have you taken any steps toward this, like maybe getting help from a therapist or talking to your doctor?2. Do what you can to help your ex, even if you never date again you still care about her and when you care about people you try to help them. So if you can, figure out what steps SHE is taking to deal with her Depression and bipolar tendencies. Is she on medication? Seeing a doctor? A therapist? If she isnt, you need to encourage her to do so.Having said that, you need to understand that you are not going to be able to force her to get help nor are you responsible for doing so. You have limited options and all you can do is exhaust them.3. Your relationship with her....the best way to address this one is to help yourself get over your Depression and do what you can to help her get over hers.

It was my best year because I finally got the courage to tell my parents that I was Suicidal. It was my worst year because I tried to kill myself three times that same year.

Everyone in my grade respected me, anybody else looking at my life from the outside would think that my life was great. That I had no pain, no suffering constantly going through my head, but they were wrong. I cried myself to sleep almost everyday last year and decided that I couldnt go on living this way anymore. I wanted to move in with my Dad and start school over there. I felt like a fresh start was something that would clear up my entire life and allow me to live Stress free. I was wrong, nobody knows me for who I really am. Im living a fake life in a fake shell of who I really am and it sucks.
